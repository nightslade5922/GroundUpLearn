# GroundUp Learn

An offline learning dashboard built with Java Swing and FlatLaf.

I'm 17 and currently building this as part of my university applications. It's a personal project to help me learn Java by doing something practical. The idea is to create a clean, distraction-free app where students can study, read, and reflect offline.

## Features (so far)
- 📘 Home screen with sections like Study, Focus, Journal, etc.
- 🧭 Sidebar with logo and settings button
- 🎨 FlatLaf-based modern UI
- 🔄 CardLayout screen switching

## In Progress
- 📚 PDF reading support
- ⚙️ Settings panel
- 🗂 Subject structure and file loading
- ✏️ UI polish and animations

## Tech
- Java 21
- Swing
- FlatLaf
- IntelliJ IDEA

## How to Run
- Clone this repo
- Open in IntelliJ (or any Java IDE)
- Run `App.java` from the `src` folder

## Feedback Welcome 🙏
I'm still working on this and learning as I go.  
**Any advice, feedback, or help is genuinely appreciated.**
